## Paid API

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure the sustainable development of the project, we realize that relying solely on free public welfare Keys is difficult to maintain long-term. Note: Free API does not provide any technical support. If you need stable high-concurrency API requests, please support our paid API. We sincerely hope for your understanding and support of this decision.
> 
> [🚀 **Purchase Official Direct-Connect Paid API**](https://api.v36.cm)

> Paid APIKEYs are not interchangeable with free APIKEYs. After purchase, you need to regenerate the KEY according to the card details.

### OpenAI Official Python Library

> When developing with the official OpenAI library, pass in the baseurl and apikey.
>
> [openai-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)

Using the official `python` library as an example: Note that you need to pass the `/v1/` suffix. Also, the openai library needs to be upgraded to the latest version; older versions have different parameter formats. Please refer to the official Python library documentation for details.

```python
import os
import openai

# optional; defaults to `os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']`
openai.api_key = "Your APIKEY"

# all client options can be configured just like the `OpenAI` instantiation counterpart
openai.base_url = "https://free.v36.cm/v1/"
openai.default_headers = {"x-foo": "true"}

completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hello world!",
        },
    ],
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)

# Should output: Hello there! How can I assist you today?
```

### OpenAI Official Node Library

> [openai-node](https://github.com/openai/openai-node)

Using the official `node` library as an example: Note that you need to pass the /v1 suffix.

```js
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: "Your apikey",
  basePath: "https://free.v36.cm/v1"
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

const chatCompletion = await openai.createChatCompletion({
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages: [{role: "user", content: "Hello world"}],
});

console.log(chatCompletion.data.choices[0].message.content);
```
